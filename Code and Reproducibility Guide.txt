# Code and Reproducibility Guide

This guide describes how to reproduce the experimental results reported in  
**“Large Language Model–Based Automatic Formulation for Stochastic Optimization Models.”**

## 1. API Setup
To execute the experiments, you will need an OpenAI API key.

1. Obtain a valid API key from **OpenAI**.
2. In `implementation.ipynb`, import the required modules and set the environment variable:
   ```python
   import os, run_exp
   os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your_api_key_here"
2. Running Experiments

All experiments are executed through run_exp.py. 
Example command:

!python run_exp.py --dataset ComplexOR --problem "biweekly_fleet_size_planning_2" --algorithm cot_s

The only dataset used is ComplexOR.

Problem names can be found in the dataset/ folder.

Algorithm names are listed in the baseline/ folder.
Running the above command reproduces the numerical results shown in the paper.

3. Results and Datasets

All numerical results appearing in the paper are available and visualized in
implementation.ipynb.

Datasets for replication and reproducibility are provided in the following folders:

exp_results_replication/

exp_results_replication2/

exp_results_1/

These contain all experiment logs, output files, and aggregated metrics used in the manuscript.

4. Acknowledgment of Reused Code

We gratefully acknowledge Xiao et al. (2024) for publicly releasing their implementation of Chain-of-Experts, from which we adapted several utility files (utils.py, result.py, and run_exp.py).
The original repository is available at
https://github.com/xzymustbexzy/Chain-of-Experts
.
All reused components are cited in both the manuscript and this guide in full compliance with the original license.
